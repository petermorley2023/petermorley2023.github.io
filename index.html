   <div align="center">
    <p align="center">Hello! I am a from Nassau, Bahamas and I am currently enrolled at the Denison University in Granville, Ohio. You may thing 
        why would he pick Ohio, but the liberal arts experience and the swimming program made it the perfect place for me. I am currently 
        majoring in Data Analytics with a concentration in Economics. While I would love to continue possibly in this field, I am willing
        to contribute to any background which is in need of a Data Analyst.</p>

      <p> At Denison I was a swimmer but stopped at the start of my junior year because of a repeating injury and that it was time to move on. Throughout my swim
             career I was able to travel throughout the Caribbean and compete against top tier athletes from around th world. I am forever grateful for this sport being 
             apart of my life. </p>
