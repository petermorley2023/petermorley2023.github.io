      <p align="center">Hello! I am a from Nassau, Bahamas and I am currently enrolled at the Denison University in Granville, Ohio. You may thing 
        why would he pick Ohio, but the liberal arts experience and the swimming program made it the perfect place for me. I am currently 
        majoring in Data Analytics with a concentration in Economics. While I would love to continue possibly in this field, I am willing
        to contribute to any background which is in need of a Data Analyst.</p>
